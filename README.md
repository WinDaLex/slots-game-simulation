This is a simulation of a "Slots" game from "Tiny Tower Vegas". It's known that the average payout for a play is approx. 21.3, but I still developed this for simulating "Slots" game to calculate the expectation by statistics.

The way to run the simulation is to run python code:

`import SlotsGame`  
`SlotsGame.simulation()`
